# HR-ANALYTICS-DASHBOARD
In this HR Analytics Dashboard project, we leverage the power of Power BI to transform and analyze human resources data for actionable insights. The process begins with thorough data cleaning and processing within Power BI, ensuring the dataset is optimized for analysis. Through the use of Power Query, we import and transform HR data, addressing issues such as missing values and outliers. The Power BI Dashboard is set up with a user-friendly interface, providing a comprehensive overview of key HR metrics.

The heart of the analysis lies in the implementation of Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) in Power BI. DAX formulas are applied to calculate crucial HR metrics, such as employee turnover rates, performance indices, and average tenure. Measures and calculations are carefully designed to provide a holistic view of the workforce's performance and engagement. Various charts, ranging from bar charts to line graphs, are employed to visually represent trends and patterns. Filters and slicers enhance interactivity, allowing users to tailor their view and focus on specific departments, time periods, or performance indicators. The final HR Analytics Dashboard not only provides a snapshot of the current HR landscape but also offers export functionality, enabling stakeholders to extract valuable insights for strategic decision-making.
